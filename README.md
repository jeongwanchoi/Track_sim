# üèÅ Track_sim.m
`Track_sim.m` simulates autonomous driving on an elliptical track composed of yellow and blue cones using the ERP42 model.    
It includes ROS communication, perception and decision-making, a Pure Pursuit controller, path generation, and tracking algorithms.

## How to Run
To run the simulation, first, ensure that the `erp42_ws` ROS workspace is properly set up and launched:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `erp42_ws` directory.
2. Source the workspace:
   ```sh
   source devel/setup.bash
   ```
3. Launch the ERP42 ROS environment:
   ```sh
   roslaunch erp42 erp42.launch
   ```
4. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing `Track_sim.m`.
5. Run the script:
   ```matlab
   Track_sim
   ```
